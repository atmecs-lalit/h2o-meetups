## Talk: Machine Learning in R with H2O

This presentation is a high level overview of the H2O machine learning platform. H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data. The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface. Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine.  Many supervised and unsupervised algorithms are included in H2O as well as a fully automated machine learning algorithm (H2O AutoML). 

The rest of the meetup we will review the [H2O in R tutorial](https://github.com/ledell/LatinR-2019-h2o-tutorial) (from LatinR 2019).
