## Talk: Scalable Automatic Machine Learning in H2O by Erin LeDell

The focus of this presentation is scalable and automatic machine learning using the H2O machine learning platform. H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data. The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface. Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine.

We will provide an overview of the methodology behind H2O's AutoML algorithm. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models (including multiple stacked ensemble models for superior model performance), and due to the distributed nature of the H2O platform, H2O AutoML can scale to very large datasets. The result of the AutoML run is a "leaderboard" of H2O models which can be easily exported for use in production.

R and Python code with H2O machine learning code examples are available on GitHub for participants to follow along on their laptops.
