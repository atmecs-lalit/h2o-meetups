Join us this evening to hear from our own Michelle Tanco about Explainable AI with H2O Driverless AIâ€™s Machine Learning Interpretability Module.

Explainable AI is in the news, and for good reason. Financial services companies have cited the ability to explain AI-based decisions as one of the critical roadblocks to further adoption of AI for their industry. Transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of data-driven decision support systems based on AI and machine learning are serious regulatory mandates in banking, insurance, healthcare, and other industries. From pertinent regulations to increasing customer trust, data scientists and business decision-makers must show AI-based decisions can be explained. H2O Driverless AI does explainable AI today with its machine learning interpretability (MLI) module. This capability in H2O Driverless AI employs a unique combination of techniques and methodologies to explain the results of both Driverless AI models and external models.
